The two main components of the vocabulary tab are the word list and the
detailed view.

<h2>
<a name="word_list">Word list</a>
</h2>
Initially the word list shows all words of your vocabulary. There are
two ways to search for certain entries. The first possibility is
to enter a string in the "Filter" text field and press "Enter" afterwards.
The list then shows those words which contain the filter string and those
that have a pronunciation or sense which contains it. If you want to
see the full list again, delete the string in the filter field and press
"Enter" again. <br>
<br>

<img alt="Filter" src="filter.png"> <br>
<br>
The second possibility is to activate the "Advanced filter" box and then
to define a filter in the dialog that appears after pressing the button
labelled "Advanced...".<br>
Filters are composed of one or many subfilters, each represented by a row
which contains three columns. In the first column, you select the attribute
(Original, Pronunciation etc.), in the second column the comparison type,
e.g., "equals", "greater than", "less than". In the last column the value
is entered. Dependent on the attribute and the comparison type, the value
is a string, a number, a date or a list of strings. You can add and remove
subfilters by pressing the "More" and the "Less" button, respectively, and
reset the filter by clicking on "Reset". By selecting "Match all
of the following" or "Match one of the following" you determine whether all
subfilters have to match or only one.<br>
A filter can be saved by entering a name in the field at the top of the
dialog and selecting "New/Update" after that. A saved filter is loaded 
by selecting it from the drop-down menu. You have to click "Apply" to
activate it. If you want to change an existing filter, load and modify
it and then press the "New/Update" button. Filters can be deleted by selecting
"Remove".

<h3>
<a name="columns">Selecting columns and sorting</a>
</h3>
If one right-clicks on one of the word list's column headers, a popup menu
appears which allows to sort the word list
according to the selected column.<br>
<br>

<img alt="Sorting" src="sorting.png"> <br>
<br>
The popup menu also contains the item "Select columns..." which lets the
user choose the columns for the word list. Columns can be selected and
deselected by first selecting the column name and then pressing the
left-arrow button or the right-arrow button, respectively. The order of the
column names can be changed using the up-arrow button and the down-arrow
button. The column that belongs to the uppermost column name will be shown
at the leftmost position of the word list.<br>
<br>

<img alt="Select columns" src="select_columns.png">
<br>
<br>
By pressing the "Add", "Edit" and "Remove" buttons next to the word list
you can
<a href="#add_word"> insert</a>,
<a href="#edit_word"> change</a> or
<a href="#remove_word"> delete</a> words, respectively.

<h2>
<a name="detailed_view">Detailed view</a>
</h2>
The detailed view shows spelling, pronunciation, translation
and examples of the word which is currently selected in the word list.
In the <a href="doc-settings.html#appearance-settings">Appearance tab</a>
of the settings dialog you can determine how many details are shown.
If an example is selected, the sense associated with the respective example
is highlighted. By double-clicking a certain example you get to the
<a href="doc-examples.html"> examples tab</a>.
<br>
<br>

<img alt="Details" src="details.png"><br>
<br>
In order to add more information to a word, you can specify audio or
image files, which is described in <a href="#add_word">
the next section</a>. The files appear on the detailed view as icons.
Clicking on an audio file icon results in playing the respective file,
clicking on an image file icon opens a new window which shows the image.

<h2>
<a name="add_word">Adding words </a> 
</h2>
By clicking on the "Add" button next to the word list, you can add words
to your vocabulary.	In the dialog, you can see the two text fields
"Original" and "Pronunciation". The first text field is mandatory, the
second one is optional. If the word you are going to enter has multiple
possible pronunciations, press the "More..." button.<br>
<br>

<img alt="Add word" src="add_word.png"> <br>
<br>
A word must have at least one sense. You can add senses by pressing the
"Add sense" button next to the list view and
enter strings in the "Translation"
field and in the "Definition" field. The definition of a word is a short
note about its type, usage etc. You do not need to provide strings for
both fields, one is enough. If a word has more than one sense, you can
change the order of the senses by using the arrow buttons on the left side
of the list view.<br>
<br>

<img alt="Add sense" src="add_sense.png"> <br>
<br>
After you finished editing the word, press "Apply" and the word will be added.
The dialog won't close after that - you can continue to add words or
press "Close" to return to the main window.

<h3>
<a name="advanced_settings">Advanced settings</a>
</h3>
By pressing the "Advanced..." button, you can edit some additional properties
of a word.
<p>
<img alt="Advanced settings" src="add_word_details.png"></p>

<h4>Word details</h4>
Whether you can see the Details tab of the dialog depends on
whether you have set a language for the dictionary via the 
"Edit-&gt;Properties" menu entry. In the Details tab, you can
select a word class, e.g. noun, verb etc. For some of the word classes
it may be possible to specify additional details. For example, in the image
shown above it is possible to set the gender of a noun.
<h4>Categories</h4>
A word can (optionally) be assigned to categories (e.g. lessons). You can
choose existing categories from the drop-down list or enter a new
category name. After that, press "Add".
<p>
<img alt="Multimedia" src="add_word_categories.png"></p>

<h4>Multimedia Files</h4>
You can also specify audio and image files for a word, for example a WAV
file which contains the pronunciation. It is possible to choose
whether the location of the file should be saved as a relative
(e.g. "images\image.gif") or absolute path
(e.g. "D:\jvlt\images\image.gif") by
(de)selecting the "Use relative path" checkbox. If you choose the former
option, the path will be relative to the location of your dictionary file.
For example, if your dictionary file is "D:\jvlt\dict.jvlt" and the
image location is "images\image.gif", then jVLT will look for the image
at "D:\jvlt\images\image.gif".
<br>
If jVLT cannot play or show files of a certain type, you can specify
external commands in the
<a href="doc-settings.html#multimedia_settings">
settings dialog</a>.
<p>

<h2>
<a name="edit_word">Editing words</a>
</h2>
You can edit a word by first selecting it in the
<a href="doc-vocabulary.html#word_list">word list</a> and then
pressing the "Edit" button next to the list.
Editing a single word is basically the same as adding a word. There is one
difference, though: If you want to remove a sense, you have to make sure that
there is no example linked to that sense.
<br>
If you select multiple words before you press "Edit" - either by using
the Ctrl key or the Shift key while clicking on the words - you can
alter the <a href="#advanced_settings">advanced settings</a> for all selected
words at once. However, you have to be careful: The new settings always
overwrite the old ones. For example, if you edit two words at once, one
belonging to lesson "A", the other one belonging to lesson "B", and assign a
new lesson "C" to both of them, then they will not belong to lesson "A" and "B"
any more.

<h2>
<a name="remove_word">Removing words</a>
</h2>
In order to remove words, you first have to select them in the word list
(Multiple words can be selected by using the <i>Ctrl</i> or the <i>Shift</i>
button). After pressing the "Remove" button next to the word list, a dialog
will appear that asks you to confirm your decision. Note that all links from
examples to the deleted words will be removed. If an example loses all links,
then it will be removed, too. The number of examples to be removed and
to be modified will also be shown in the dialog.
<p>

examples to a specific word, you can look at the
