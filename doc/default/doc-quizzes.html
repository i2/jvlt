jVLT offers an option to perform quizzes on your vocabulary. Words are
assigned to different <i>batches</i> depending on whether
you knew it	during the quiz. The batch number of known words increases
(for example, a word with batch No. <i>1</i> is assigned
to batch No. <i>2</i> after the quiz), not known words are
assigned to batch No. <i>0</i>. After the quiz, a word
becomes inactive for a certain period of time which depends on its
current batch. "Inactive" means that a word will not be queried during
a quiz. The date a word becomes active again is also called
"expiry date". The time until expiry can be adjusted in the
<a href="doc-settings.html#general_settings">settings dialog</a>. The
default values are given below:
<ul>

<li>Batch No. 0: 0 days</li>

<li>Batch No. 1: 1 days</li>

<li>Batch No. 2: 3 days</li>

<li>Batch No. 3: 9 days</li>

<li>Batch No. 4: 27 days</li>

<li>Batch No. 5: 81 days</li>

<li>Batch No. 6: 283 days</li>

<li>Batch No. 7: 849 days</li>

</ul>
To start a quiz, press the "Start" button on the quiz
tab.<br>

</h2>
Before starting a quiz, you can restrict the words to be quizzed
to certain word groups by pressing on the "Select words..." button which
opens a dialog of the same name. In the dialog, four methods for selecting
words are offered:
<ul>

<li>
<b>All words:</b>
All words will be quizzed.
</li>

<li>
<b>Only words matching the specified filter:</b>
Only words that match a certain filter will be quizzed. If this option
is selected, a filter has to be specified by pressing the "Filter..." button.
The dialog that opens thereafter is described
<a href="doc-vocabulary.html#word_list">here</a>.
</li>

<li>
<b>Apply multiple filters successively:</b>
You can also select multiple filters that will be applied successively. For
example, you can specify that first all the words that have not been tested
before will be quizzed, and after that the words of a certain lesson. You can
add new filters by clicking on the "Manager filters..." button.
</li>

<li>
<b>Only words matching category criteria specified below:</b>
Select this option if you want to quickly select the categories that
should (not) be quizzed.
</li>

</ul>

jVLT quizzes on the "Original" field by default. You can design
other types of quizzes by using the dialog that appears after pressing
the "Manage quiz types..." button.
<br>
<br>

<img alt="Manage quiz types" src="quiz_type_dialog.png">
<br>
<br>
In the dialog, you select the field to quiz on, and the fields which are
shown during the quiz question. You also have to name the newly created
quiz type by entering a name into the text field at the top of the dialog
and pressing "New/Update" afterwards. You can also change existing
quiz types by selecting them via the drop-down menu at the top of the dialog
and pressing "New/Update" after the changes have been made.
<br>
<br>
After having added a new quiz type and closing the dialog by pressing
"OK", you can select the new quiz type via the
"Select quiz type" drop-down menu.

<a name="during_the_quiz">During the quiz</a>
</h2>
Dependent on what you configured in the
<a href="doc-settings.html#quiz_settings">quiz settings</a>,
a quiz can be performed in two different ways. The first possibility is
that you enter the solution which is shown in the figure below.
<br>
<br>

<img alt="Input Answer" src="quiz_input_answer.png">
<br>
<br>
After you pressed "Next", the solution is shown and a message appears
saying whether your answer was correct or not.
<br>
<br>

<img alt="Show Answer" src="quiz_show_answer.png">
<br>
<br>
The second possibility is that you do not enter the solution (you can write
it on a piece of paper instead), and jVLT asks you - after you pressed
"Next" - whether you knew the correct answer.
<br>
<br>

<img alt="Show Answer" src="quiz-2.png">
<br>
<br>
You can cancel a quiz at any time by pressing "Finish". In the next
section, it is described what happens thereafter.

<h2>
<a name="after_the_quiz">After the quiz</a>
</h2>
If you decided to finish the quiz, jVLT asks whether you want to repeat the
words you did not know. Afterwards two lists are displayed which show those
words you knew and those you did not know, respectively. If you mistakenly
classified known words as not known or vice versa, you can now correct
your mistakes by selecting the respective words and press the arrow buttons.
At last, you can decide whether to save the results of this quiz so they
can be taken into account for future quizzes.<br>
